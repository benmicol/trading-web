GEMS REQUIRED:

1. ferret-0.10.9 (doesn't work with later versions. used to search companies for autocomplete): gem install ferret -v0.10.9
2. money-1.7.1  -  gem install --source http://dist.leetsoft.com money
  Problems:
  when rails is fixed from "require_gem" to "gem" the money gem throws exception:
  c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/money-1.7.1/lib/support/cattr_accessor.rb:7:in `cattr_reader': undefined method `id
2name' for {:instance_writer=>false}:Hash (NoMethodError)
